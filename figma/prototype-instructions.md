# Prototype instructions

Use these steps to create a Figma prototype that satisfies the course requirement:

1. Create a new Figma file and add four frames: Home, About, Work, Contact.
2. Apply the brand colors and type scale from `brand.md`.
3. Add navigation on each frame that mirrors the site header.
4. Add simple interactions (On click: Navigate) between frames.
5. Share the prototype link and, if required, export PNGs into this folder.

If you prefer, export the frames as PNG and add them here as evidence of your prototype.
