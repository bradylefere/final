          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I am a student at Mitchigan State University, I am a senior in Information Science. I like to write down my thoughts and have never written story before, but want to some day. I enjoy reading stories, usually nonfiction, and like to journal!</p>
          <h2>Why I Write</h2>
          <p>Writing is how I make sense of the world. I’m fascinated by the way stories can connect people, spark curiosity, and help us see from new perspectives. My goal is to write books that are honest, thoughtful, and a little bit surprising.</p>

          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Journaling and personal essays</li>
            <li>Exploring nonfiction and biographys</li>
            <li>Watching story videos and movies</li>
            <li>Playing story games</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Inspiration</h2>
          <p>I’m inspired by movies and shows that create cool worlds and stories that go with them, conversations with friends and family, and other books that I've read. I believe that most things have a story to them and it's interesting to follow those stories.</p>
